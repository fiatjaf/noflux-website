Noflux can send notifications to any [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) server.

To enable this integration, go to **Settings > Integrations > Matrix Bot** and enter the relevant information.

The recommendation is to create a specific user for the Noflux integration:

- The Matrix username uses this format: `@username:homeserver.tld`, for example: `@example:matrix.org`
- The Matrix URL is the base URL of your Matrix server. For example: `https://matrix.org`
- The Matrix Room ID can be found by using a client like [Element](https://element.io/): **Room Settings > Advanced > Internal Room ID**. The format is `!localid:homeserver.tld`, for example: `!RXRwLGkDQJzA:matrix.org`.

As the time of writing this document, the Matrix notifications looks like this when using the [Element](https://element.io/) client:
