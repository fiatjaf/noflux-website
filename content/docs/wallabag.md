[Wallabag](https://wallabag.org/) is a self-hosted application for
saving web pages.

- The API URL is the root URL of your instance, for example, if you have the hosted version use: `https://app.wallabag.it/`.
- To create a new API client, go to the section "API clients management" and choose "Create a new client".
- If `Send only URL` is checked, Noflux sends only the URL of the item being saved, instead of the item's page body content.
