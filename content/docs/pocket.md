To configure the Pocket integration on your own Noflux instance, you
need to create an application on Pocket's website.

Go to <https://getpocket.com/developer/apps/new> and create a new application.

- You can define the *Pocket Consumer Key* for all users by using the environment variable `POCKET_CONSUMER_KEY`.
- Or, you can set the *Pocket Consumer Key* only for your user by using the form and hitting the update button.

If the environment variable is defined, the text field for the *Pocket
Consumer API key* will be hidden.

Make sure the environment variable `BASE_URL` is defined properly to
allow the authorization flow to work afterward, this variable should
point to your current instance address and/or the URL you have
set on your Pocket application.

Once the consumer key is configured, you need to get a *Pocket Access
Token*. This token could be fetched automatically by using the
authorization flow or manually by making some HTTP calls.

The simplest solution is to use the link, **"Connect your Pocket
account"**. This method redirects the end user to Pocket's website and
ask for authorization.

After the authorization is given, Noflux will fetch the *Pocket Access
Token* for you.

If you prefer to fetch *Pocket Access Token* manually, the process is described in [Pocket's developer documentation](https://getpocket.com/developer/docs/authentication).
