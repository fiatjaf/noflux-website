Noflux is a minimalist software. **The purpose of this application is to read feeds**. _Nothing else_.

<h2 id="simplicity">Focus on Simplicity <a class="anchor" href="#simplicity" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- Having a gazillion of features makes the software hard to maintain, hard to troubleshoot and increase the number of bugs.
- This software doesn't try to satisfy the needs of everyone.

<h2 id="ui">Why the user interface is ugly? <a class="anchor" href="#ui" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- The Noflux layout is optimized to scan entries quickly.
- The design of Noflux is inspired by [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/), [Lobsters](https://lobste.rs/) and [Pinboard](https://pinboard.in/).

<h2 id="feature-request">Why are you not developing my feature request? <a class="anchor" href="#feature-request" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

- Developing a software takes a lot of time. Don't expect anyone to work for free.
- As mentioned above, the number of features is voluntarily limited. Nobody likes bloatware.
- Improving existing features is more important than adding new ones.

<h2 id="golang">Why choose Golang as programming language? <a class="anchor" href="#golang" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

[Go](https://golang.org/) is probably the best choice for self-hosted software:

- Go is a simple programming language.
- Running code concurrently is part of the language.
- It's faster than a scripting language like PHP or Python.
- The final application is a binary compiled statically without any dependency.
- You just need to drop the executable on your server to deploy the application.
- You don't have to worry about what version of PHP/Python is installed on your machine.
- Packaging the software using RPM/Debian/Docker is straightforward.
- No dependency hell.

<h2 id="postgresql">Why PostgreSQL? <a class="anchor" href="#postgresql" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Noflux is compatible only with [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/).

- Supporting multiple databases increases the complexity of the software.
- We do not have the resources to test the software with all major versions of MySQL, MariaDB, SQLite, and so on.
- [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/) is excellent but there is a limited support of `ALTER TABLE` and the [Golang driver](https://github.com/mattn/go-sqlite3) requires [CGO](https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/) and [GCC](https://gcc.gnu.org/). Noflux was initially designed as [Twelve-Factor App](https://12factor.net/) to run in ephemeral containers.
- PostgreSQL is powerful, rock solid and battle tested.
- PostgreSQL is a great independent open source software.
- ORM abstracts interesting features provided by the database.
- Noflux uses `hstore/jsonb/inet` data types, window functions, full-text search and handles user timezones with PostgreSQL.

<h2 id="js-framework">Why no Javascript framework? <a class="anchor" href="#js-framework" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Noflux uses Javascript only where it's necessary.

- Server side template rendering is very simple and fast enough for that kind of application.
- Using Javascript frameworks increase complexity.
- The Javascript ecosystem is moving all the time, sticking to the standard is probably more sustainable.
- Having too many dependencies is painful to maintain and update on the long term.

<h2 id="es6">Why only ECMAScript 6? <a class="anchor" href="#es6" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Noflux uses [ECMAScript 6](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript#6th_Edition_-_ECMAScript_2015) and the Fetch API.

- All modern browsers support ES6 nowadays.
- Only Internet Explorer doesn't support ES6, but who cares?
- Using a Javascript transpiler introduce another set of useless dependencies.


<h2 id="mobile-app">Why there is no mobile application? <a class="anchor" href="#mobile-app" title="Permalink">¶</a></h2>

Using the web UI on your smartphone is not so bad:

- Noflux is a [progressive web app](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Progressive_web_apps)
- The layout adapts to the screen size (responsive design)
- You could add the application to the home screen like any native application
- You can swipe entries horizontally to change their status
- The web browser is a pretty good sandbox, the application cannot access to the data stored on your phone
- It's cross platform: works on iOS and Android

The development of mobile clients is left to the open source community:

- Developing a native mobile application for each platform (iOS and Android) and different devices (smartphones and tablets) takes a lot of work
- The main developer of Noflux is not a mobile application developer
- You have to pay a fee to publish your app on the store even if your app doesn't make any money
